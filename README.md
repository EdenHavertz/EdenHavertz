- 👋 Hi, I’m @EdenHavertz but you can simply call me Eden.
- 👀 I’m interested in game developing, I'm currently a beginer but I'm looking foward to becoming a veteran as I progress.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science and Information Technology at The Co-operative University of Kenya, self tutoring in HTML, C++, C# and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enhancing games into various preferences for gamers like me and to learn more about ethical hacking.
- 📫 How to reach me, you can contact me on Instagram my username is @_._e.d.e.n_._, as I said, at the moment I only know the basics to game development so I might not be able to answer complex questions.
